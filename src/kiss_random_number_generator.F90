! 64-bit KISS RNGs
!
! Consistent with the Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle,
! I have previously suggested 32-bit KISS Random Number
! Generators (RNGs) that seem to have been frequently adopted.
!
! Having had requests for 64-bit KISSes, and now that
! 64-bit integers are becoming more available, I will
! describe here a 64-bit KISS RNG, with comments on
! implementation for various languages, speed, periods
! and performance after extensive tests of randomness.
!
! This 64-bit KISS RNG has three components, each nearly
! good enough to serve alone. The components are:
! Multiply-With-Carry (MWC), period (2^121+2^63-1)
! Xorshift (XSH), period 2^64-1
! Congruential (CNG), period 2^64
!
! Compact C and Fortran listings are given below. They
! can be cut, pasted, compiled and run to see if, after
! 100 million calls, results agree with that provided
! by theory, assuming the default seeds.
!
! Users may want to put the content in other forms, and,
! for general use, provide means to set the 250 seed bits
! required in the variables x,y,z (64 bits) and c (58 bits)
! that have been given default values in the test versions.
!
! The C version uses #define macros to enumerate the few
! instructions that MWC, XSH and CNG require. The KISS
! macro adds MWC+XSH+CNG mod 2^64, so that KISS can be
! inserted at any place in a C program where a random 64-bit
! integer is required.
! Fortran's requirement that integers be signed makes the
! necessary code more complicated, hence a function KISS().
!

! KISS=x+y+z
! return; end
! ---------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Output from using the macro KISS or the function KISS()	is
! MWC+XSH+CNG mod 2^64.
!
! CNG is easily implemented on machines with 64-bit integers,
! as arithmetic is automatically mod 2^64, whether integers
! are considered signed or unsigned. The CNG statement is
! z=6906969069*z+1234567.
! When I established the lattice structure of congruential
! generators in the 60's, a search produced 69069 as an easy-
! to-remember multiplier with nearly cubic lattices in 2,3,4,5-
! space, so I tried concatenating, using 6906969069 as
! my first test multiplier. Remarkably---a seemingly one in many
! hundreds chance---it turned out to also have excellent lattice
! structure in 2,3,4,5-space, so that's the one chosen.
! (I doubt if lattice structure of CNG has much influence on the
! composite 64-bit KISS produced via MWC+XSH+CNG mod 2^64.)
!
!
! XSH, the Xorshift component, described in
! www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper
! uses three invocations of an integer "xor"ed with a shifted
! version of itself.
! The XSH component used for this KISS is, in C notation:
! y^=(y<<13); y^=(y>>17); y^=(y<<43)
! with Fortran equivalents y=ieor(y,ishft(y,13)), etc., although
! this can be effected by a Fortran statement function:
! f(y,k)=ieor(y,ishft(y,k))
! y=f(f(f(y,13),-17),43)
! As with lattice structure, choice of the triple 13,-17,43 is
! probably of no particular importance; any one of the 275 full-
! period triples listed in the above article is likely to provide
! a satisfactory component XSH for the composite MWC+XSH+CNG.
!
! The choice of multiplier 'a' for the multiply-with-carry (MWC)
! component of KISS is not so easily made. In effect, a multiply-
! with-carry sequence has a current value x and current "carry" c,
! and from each given x,c a new x,c pair is constructed by forming
! t=a*x+c, then x=t mod b=2^64 and c=floor(t/b).
! This is easily implemented for 32-bit computers that permit
! forming a*t+c in 64 bits, from which the new x is the bottom and
! the new c the top 32-bits.
!
! When a,x and c are 64-bits, not many computers seem to have an easy
! way to form t=a*x+c in 128 bits, then extract the top and bottom
! 64-bit segments. For that reason, special choices for 'a' are
! needed among those that satisfy the general requirement that
! p=a*b-1 is a prime for which b=2^64 has order (p-1)/2.
!
! My choice---and the only one of this form---is a=2^58+1. Then the
! top 64 bits of an imagined 128-bit t=a*x+c may be obtained as
! (using C notation) (x>>6)+ 1 or 0, depending
! on whether the 64-bit parts of (x<<58)+c+x cause an overflow.
! Since (x<<58)+c cannot itself cause overflow (c will always be <a),
! we get the carry as c=(x>>6) plus overflow from (x<<58)+x.
!
! This is easily done in C with unsigned integers, using a different
! kind of 't': t=(x<<58)+c; c=(x>>6); x=t+x; c=c+(x<t);
! For Fortran and others that permit only signed integers, more work
! is needed.
! Equivalent mod 2^64 versions of t=(x<<58)+c and c=(x>>6) are easy,
! and if s(x) represents (x>>63) in C or ishft(x,-66) in Fortran,
! then for signed integers, the new carry c comes from the rule
! if s(x) equals s(t) then c=(x>>6)+s(x) else c=(x>>6)+1-s(x+t)
!
! Speed:
! A C version of this KISS RNG takes 18 nanosecs for each
! 64-bit random number on my desktop (Vista) PC, thus
! producing KISSes at a rate exceeding 55 million per second.
! Fortran or other integers-must-be-signed compilers might get
! "only" around 40 million per second.
!
! Setting seeds:
! Use of KISS or KISS() as a general 64-bit RNG requires specifying
! 3*64+58=250 bits for seeds, 64 bits each for x,y,z and 58 for c,
! resulting in a composite sequence with period around 2^250.
! The actual period is
! (2^250+2^192+2^64-2^186-2^129)/6 ~= 2^(247.42) or 10^(74.48).
! We "lose" 1+1.58=2.58 bits from maximum possible period, one bit
! because b=2^64, a square, cannot be a primitive root of p=ab-1,
! so the best possible order for b is (p-1)/2.
! The periods of MWC and XSH have gcd 3=2^1.58, so another 1.58
! bits are "lost" from the best possible period we could expect
! from 250 seed bits.
!
! Some users may think 250 seed bits are an unreasonable requirement.
! A good seeding procedure might be to assume the default seed
! values then let the user choose none, one, two,..., or all
! of x,y,z, and c to be reseeded.
!
! Tests:
! Latest tests in The Diehard Battery, available at
! http://i.cs.hku.hk/~diehard/
! were applied extensively. Those tests that specifically required
! 32-bit integers were applied to the leftmost 32 bits
! (e,g, KISS>>32;), then to the middle 32-bits ((KISS<<16)>>32;)
! then to the rightmost 32 bits, ( (KISS<<32)>>32).
! There were no extremes in the more than 700 p-values returned
! by the tests, nor indeed for similar tests applied to just two of the
! KISS components: MWC+XSH, then MWC+CNG, then XSH+CNG.
!
! The simplicity, speed, period around 2^250 and performance on
! tests of randomness---as well as ability to produce exactly
! the same 64-bit patterns, whether considered signed or unsigned
! integers---make this 64-bit KISS well worth considering for
! adoption or adaption to languages other than C or Fortran,
! as has been done for 32-bit KISSes.

!   On Nov 3 I posted
!
!   RNGs: A Super KISS sci.math, comp.lang.c, sci.crypt
!
!   a KISS (Keep-It-Simple-Stupid) RNG combining,
!   by addition mod 2^32, three simple RNGs:
!   CMWC(Complementary-Multiply-With-Carry)+CNG(Congruential)
!   +XS(Xorshift)
!   with resulting period greater than 10^402575.
!
!   The extreme period comes from finding a prime p=a*b^r+1 for
!   which the order of b has magnitude near p-1, then use
!   the CMWC method, the mathematics of which I outline here:
!
!   Let Z be the set of all "vectors" of the form
!   [x_1,...,x_r;c] with 0<=x_i<b and 0<=c<a.
!   Then Z has ab^r elements, and if the function f() on Z is
!   f([x_1,x2,...,x_r;c])=
!   [x_2,...,x_r,b-1-(t mod b);trunc((t/b)], t=a*x_1+c
!   then f() has an inverse on Z: for each z in Z there is exactly
!   one w in Z for which f(w)=z:
!   f^{-1}([x_1,x2,...,x_r;c])=
!   [trunc((v/a),x_1,...,x_{r-1}; v mod a], v=cb+(b-1)-x_r
!
!   Thus a directed graph based on z->f(z) will consist only
!   of disjoint loops of size s=order(b,p) and there will be
!   L=ab^r/s such loops.
!
!   A random uniform choice of z from Z is equally likely to
!   fall in any one of the L loops, and then each "vector" in
!   the sequence obtained by iterating f:
!   f(z), f(f(z)), f(f(f(z))),...
!   will have a uniform distribution over that loop, and the sequence
!   determined by taking the r'th element from each "vector",
!   (the output of the CMWC RNG) will be periodic with period
!   the order of b for the prime p=ab^r+1, and that sequence
!   will produce, in reverse order, the base-b expansion of a
!   rational k/p for some k determined by choice of the seed z.
!
!   For that Nov 3 post, I had found that the order of b=2^32
!   for the prime p=7010176*b^41790+1 is 54767*2^1337279, about
!   10^402566, thus providing an easily-implemented
!   KISS=CMWC+CNG+XS RNG with immense period and
!   excellent performance on tests of randomness.
!
!   That easy implementation required carrying out the essential
!   parts of the CMWC function f(): form t=7010176*x+c in 64 bits,
!   extract the top 32 bits for the new c, the bottom 32 for
!   the new x---easy to do in C, not easy in Fortran.
!   And if we want 64-bit random numbers, with B=2^64, our prime
!   becomes 7010176*B^20985+1, for which the period of B is
!   54767*2^1337278, still immense, but in C, with 64-bit x,c
!   there seems no easy way to form t=7010176*x+c in 128 bits,
!   then extract the top and bottom 64 bit halves.
!
!   So base b=2^32 works for C but not Fortran,
!   and base B=2^64 works for neither C nor Fortran.
!
!   I offer here is a prime that provides CMWC RNGs for both
!   32- and 64-bits, and for both C and Fortran, and with
!   equally massive periods, again greater than 2^(1.3million):
!
!   p=640*b^41265+1 = 2748779069440*B^20632+1 = 5*2^1320487+1.
!
!   That prime came from the many who have dedicated their
!   efforts and computer time to prime searches. After some
!   three weeks of dedicated computer time using pfgw with
!   scrypt, I found the orders of b and B:
!   5*2^1320481 for b=2^32, 5*2^1320480 for B=2^64.
!
!   It is the choice of the "a" that makes it feasible to get
!   the top and bottom valves of t=a*x+c, yet stay within the
!   integer sizes the C or Fortran compilers are set for.
!   In the above prime: a=640=2^9+2^7 for b=2^32 and
!   a=2748779069440=2^41+2^39 for B=2^64.
!   Thus, for example with b=2^32 and using only 32-bit C code,
!   with a supposed 128-bit t=(2^9+2^7)*x+c, the top and bottom
!   32-bits of t may be obtained by setting, say,
!   h=(c&1); z=(x<<9)>>1 + (x<<7)>>1 + c>>1;
!   then the top half of that t would be
!   c=(x>>23)+(x>>25)+(z>>31);
!   and the bottom half, before being complemented, would be
!   x=(z<<1)+h;
!
!   When B=2^64 we need only change to
!   h=(c&1); z=(x<<41)>>1 + (x<<39)>>1 + c>>1;
!   c=(x>>23)+(x>>25)+(z>>63);
!
!   These C operations all have Fortran equivalents, and will
!   produce the required bit patterns, whether integers are
!   considered signed or unsigned. (In C, one must make sure
!   that the >> operation performs a logical right shift,
!   perhaps best done via "unsigned" declarations.)
!
!   The CMWC z "vector" elements [x_1,x_2,...,x_r] are kept in
!   an array, Q[] in C, Q() in Fortran, with a separate current
!   "carry". This is all spelled out in the following examples:
!   code for 32- and 64-bit SuperKiss RNGs for C and Fortran.
!
!   Note that in these sample listings, the Q array is seeded
!   by CNG+XS, based on the seed values specified in the
!   initial declarations. For many simulation studies, the
!   73 bits needed to seed the initial xcng, xs and carry<a
!   for the 32-bit version, or 169 bits needed for the 64-bit
!   version, may be adequate.
!   But more demanding applications may require a significant
!   portion of the >1.3 million seed bits that Q requires.
!   See text and comments from the Nov 3 posting.
!
!   I am indebted to an anonymous mecej4 for providing the basic
!   form and KIND declarations of the Fortran versions.
!
!   Please let me and other readers know if the results are not
!   as specified when run with your compilers, or if you can
!   provide equivalent versions in other programming languages.
